## Security
AES is a widely-used and trusted encryption algorithm, and the encryption performed by CipherFi is very secure. However, it is important to remember that the security of your encrypted text ultimately depends on the strength of your password. Be sure to choose a strong, unique password that cannot be easily guessed.

We hope you find CipherFi useful! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
